Today, however, it is so archaic, convoluted, and long that many dispute the meaning of its dogma, though none can deny its value as a mythic text. The Old Church of the chroniclers has splintered into factions that mostly squabble over its meaning and try to draw some angle from its numerous and sometimes contradictory adaptions into holy texts. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the Chant still holds power - real, tangible power - to heal, mend, and uplift.

Faithful villagers tend to pay their respects to the local nature spirits or the Titans at shrines or holy sites such as pools or groves.<br/><br/>Villagers tend to be proud of their local traditions, festivals, and gods. Most villages have a regional cooking or craft specialty, and people will often visit from many towns over just to sample them. One village might specialize in iron and smithing work, another might be known for the quality of its steamed buns and its pork, and another might have miles of beautiful grazing pastures and be known for the quality of its milk and dairy products.<br/><br/>Regional village councils sometimes will gather a militia to defend against a surfacing ruin or a blight, and those towns very close to the ruins typically have a wall to keep out roaming monsters.

They are pulled by draft beasts and sometimes captive monsters, who are kept docile by Leggio beast tamers.<br/><br/>Leggio are nearly all armed and trained in fighting since they were young as they often have to pass through dangerous or blighted areas in order to reach a town in need.

Sometimes this involves venturing into the ruins themselves (though never too far for most Churners, they leave that up to the adventurers and the foolhardy), and scraping Dust from the ruins, or searching the surface levels for fragments of Arkentech. Most of the time this involves directly servicing the adventurers themselves who venture into the ruins by supplying them with necessary food, supplies, arms and armor, and elixirs. When a new ruin is discovered or surfaces from deep beneath the earth, it is not uncommon for a Churner camp to appear at the edge shortly after, like a spray of brightly blossoming flowers over a grave.<br/><br/>Especially brave Churners will sometimes set upshop within the surface levels of a dungeon,sometimes maintaining large crops of herbs,fungi, or other staples that will only grow in thedust-soaked environment of the arkenruins. Themore daring of them will hire themselves out asguides, tinkers, or hirelings for wealthieradventurers. Due to their unique livingcircumstances, most Churners tend to know moreabout monsters than any other culture, mostlytheir spoor, habits, and how to avoid them.<br/><br/>Churners are a highly itinerant culture, and while some travel together, they tend to congregate only when a new dungeon surfaces and the old sites dry up. Many of them are former adventurers who have settled out of obligation or necessity and seek a slightly more respectable existence, but others are skilled merchants, crafts-kin, cooks, smiths, and suppliers that come from old families of Churners and run their tents and wagons with a high respect of the Churner Code (honesty, safety, convenience). Recently, due to the increasing ruin activity, the number of Churners has been rapidly increasing, and a lot of the old and more respectable families complain of grifters, swindlers, and ill-intentioned shady merchants sullying their reputation.",

      "name": "Chronicler",
      "description": "The ancient monasteries of the Chroniclers dot Arden Eld, overlooking its deep valleys from mountain perches, or buried deep in the rifts of its canyons. Within is buried ancient knowledge - and sometimes dangerous secrets.<br/><br/>Chroniclers are a unique, isolated culture - a quasi-religious society of monks and acolytes built around the Chambers - the great monasteries of the continent, whose building predates the Arken and survived their fall. There are twelve of these ancient edifices, and they are typically located in extreme or hard to reach locales, requiring them to be self sufficient. Small monastery towns and trading posts grew up around them over time, forming a tight-knit communities that revolved around and intermeshed with monastery life -moving with their festivals, rituals, and traditions.<br/><br/>The Chambers are part temple, part archive, and part prison. As legend goes, they were built to protect the great secrets of the making of the world. Some of their inner vaults now lie empty, and three of the Chambers are broken and hollow ruins, whatever was contained within long disgorged into the world. The inner passages and halls of the Chambers are rumored to be full of all kinds of secret knowledge, ancient weaponry, and old and powerful evils - though none can say for sure.<br/><br/>As for the Chroniclers themselves, they live in a strict, hierarchical, and somewhat spartan society, but one which values justice, education, equality, and honesty. Ascending up the ranks of the priesthood takes a long time and a lot of ceremony, and only the most senior monks are allowed into the central halls of a Chamber.<br/><br/>It is not uncommon at all for monks to dip and out of the priesthood in order to have families, explore the world, or go on missions of utmost import for the monastery. Junior temple acolytes wishing to become higher members of a Chronicler order are often required to leave the temple for a while to find purpose in the greater world.<br/><br/>Chroniclers highly value knowledge of all kinds, and tend to be highly educated. This drive often pushes traveling chroniclers to explore ruins, challenge authorities, or pry where they don't belong, often getting them into danger.",

      "name": "Guilder",
      "description": "There are no nations in Arden Eld, but its cities are growing in both size and influence. Their cobbled streets and teetering towers are expanding and stretching to the sky, and the fires of industry and arkentech burn deep in their bellies.<br/><br/>Those that live in the cities are known as Guilders, and often belong to one of the great Trade Guilds, loose and oligarchical organizations that regulate the trade and production of certain items between cities and act as informal government associations of sorts. Cities are often ruled by the guilds or their proxies and to most people of Arden Eld are chaotic, overcrowded, wondrous, and very smelly places where the food is greasy, the markets are  bright and burgeoning, and the sights are as incredible as they are strange.<br/><br/>Cities are the centers of technology and magic in Arden Eld and are the chief drivers of the hunger for Dust and arkentech, which the technomagical institutes and Guilds use to produce mechanical and magical wonders. Citizens of the great cities of Arden Eld are the most diverse in background and profession, and tend to enjoy a higher standard of living than those in the Green, with access to many conveniences such as rail and airship travel, running water, and arkenlamp lighting. However, they also are the most unequal, with many Kin languishing crammed into hot and overcrowded residences in the increasingly maze-like city depths, while the Guild Barons at the top scrape most of the benefits off for themselves while claiming to be acting for the benefit of all. Some predict the coming of the Churning Age will extend this way of life even out to the Green, and fear what that portends.<br/><br/>Guilders tend to be more educated, more knowledgeable about Aetheric principles and more connected to magic and science than other Kin, who they may see as backwards. They also tend to be very tolerant and welcoming, and the most worldly of Kin.",
      "values": "<b>Tolerance, patience, drive, and friendliness</b> are highly valued by Guilders. Outsiders can sometimes see them as haughty, know-it-all, or pampered."

      "image": "Thrynn.png",
      "description": "The Aethrynn, or Thrynn (most commonly) are found everywhere across Arden Eld. They are an adaptable, diverse people with a strong sensitivity to Aether and a strong connection to arkentech, some say because they are direct descendants of the Arken that survived or fled the Doom and the dark age that followed. They make up a large part of airship crews and captains in the great Guilds due to their potential for aether sensitivity making them excellent pilots.<br/><br/>Thrynn are made up of a dazzling swathe of backgrounds that span the continent. They tend to live in clans that cluster into villages, towns, and city associations. Symbology and culture of the ancient Thrynn clans, called the Seven Families, are present in many modern cultures of Arden Eld, and some draw strength and purpose from their ancient texts and teachings.<br/><br/>Some Thrynn will occasionally have small glowing 'star-marks' on their body, especially when attuned to or channeling strong sources of Aether. These can form constellations of stars or twisting branch-like patterns under their skin. Occasionally these marks are strong enough that even being near to a strong source of Aether is enough to light them up.<br/><br/>Very rarely, Thrynn are born with delicate vestigial insect-like wings, not capable of flight. Children born this way are given special attention, having been divinely marked, and often have roles in the community leadership or priesthood prepared for them. They may grow into these roles or eventually reject them."

      "image": "Trogg.png",
      "description": "Troggs, also called Ogres, are horned demi-giants that are few in number but outsize in stature. Legend has it that the Troggs descend from the Titans who originally kept the four pillars of the world stable before they were slain by the Arken, or at least have some titan blood running through their veins. Adult Troggs typically stand anywhere between six and eight feet tall, and never stop growing throughout their very long lifetimes, sometimes living four or five hundred years and growing to truly enormous stature. All have horns of various size and shapes, and some are born with tails. The Troggs reproduce slowly, have few children, and treasure them greatly. Trogg children spend a long time maturing and only reach adulthood around forty years old.<br/><br/>Like other Kin, Troggs are hugely diverse in their backgrounds and cultures but due to their small numbertend to be loners or outsiders to the communities they join. In legends, they are supernaturally tolerant of heat and can handle even molten metal with their bare hands, though how much this holds up in real life varies from Trogg to Trogg. Very traditional Troggs worship the Elden Flame, the primal force of creation, and give themselves over to the study of smithing or the etherial arts. Since Trogg artisans live a long time, they can accumulate several lifetimes of knowledge that Kin from a similar background could accumulate."

      "image": "Beastfolk.png",
      "description": "The variety of animal-like Kin found across Arden Eld can be broadly called Beastfolk. They are the most common Kin and the most diverse physically. There are many clans of beast folk, including: <ul><li><i>The Lopen</i> are cat or rabbit-like folk originally from the great plains.</li><li><i>The Garou</i> are wolf or dog-like folk from the deep forest and islands.</li><li><i>The Goblins</i> or <i>Vodya</i> are amphibious river-dwelling kin.</li><li><i>The Lorito</i> are feathered, bird-like kin originally hailing from the high steppe.</li></ul>There are many other beast folk clans, such as the fishlike <i>Pelagia</i> and reptilian <i>Kuroki</i> from the eastern mountains, and probably still many more that are hidden and spread across the surface of Arden Eld.<br/><br/>Beastfolk tend to be shorter in stature than Thrynn, though some are taller and hardier. They live around the same time as Thrynn and culturally tend have large families. Beast folk are present in every culture, from desert dwelling nomads, to pastoral farmers, to city guilds.<br/><br/>Traditional Beastfolk have a strong connection to the earth and the forest. They are strong woodsfolk, hearty eaters, and excellent hunters. They have better senses than other Kin and are sensitive to the changes in wind, moisture, and earth that signal the weather, the crops, or the changing of the seasons. Their excellent sense of taste and smell lead a lot of beastfolk to become excellent cooks (or picky eaters)."

      "image": "Xixo.png",
      "description": "The insectile or crustacean-like Xixo (ZIK-zo) are a group of water-dwelling kin that can traditionally be found as traders up and down the waterways of Arden Eld. Xixo are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for very long periods of time. They vary widely in physiology, though they are unique in that during spawning season they can change sex, and many Xixo swap around throughout their lives. Though they can have weak eyesight, they are highly sensitive to smell and chemical signals and Xixo can communicate simply emotions or moods to each other through pheromonal markers, leading to the stereotype that they can read each other's minds.<br/><br/>Though individual Xixo live much shorter lives than other Kin, maturing at around 8 and typically living until their mid 40s, they have perfect memories, able to recall everything in their lives with absolute clarity. A common understanding among the Xixo is that other Kin are terribly cursed - living twice as long as the Xixo, but eventually forgetting a large part of their lives."
